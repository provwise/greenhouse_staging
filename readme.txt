This project is a work in progress. I'm slowly collecting parts and building the code to run an automated greenhouse. The greenhouse will have the following 
features:

- temperature and humidity sensor
- ventilation triggered by temperature and/or humidity readings
- moisture sensors to read soil moisture levels
- water pump triggered by moisture readings
- ultrasonic sensor to track how full the water tank is
- lcd display panel for updates on all of the above

The greenhouse will be powered by a Raspberry Pi 3 B+
